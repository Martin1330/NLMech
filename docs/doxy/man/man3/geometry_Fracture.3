.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A class for fracture state of bonds\&. 

In this class fracture state of each bonds (i\&.e\&. whether the bond is broken or not) is stored\&. It also comes with the access to the state of bond\&.

.PP
Vector which stores the state of bonds\&. Given node i, vector d_fracture[i] is the list of state of bonds of node i\&.

\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
1\&. Since we only need single bit, as fracture state is either 0 (not broken) or 1 (broken), we can further optimize the memory\&. Currently, we store 4 bit per bond\&. In future we can try to reduce it to just 2 or 1 bit per bond\&.
.PP
2\&. According to \fCComparing vector<bool> and vector<char>\fP the vector<char> is faster for small size of vector\&. Since list of bonds for each node is smaller number, we use vector<char>\&.
.PP
3\&. Both speed optimization and memory optimization is required to store the fracture state efficiently\&.
