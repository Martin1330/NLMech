# NLMech
Welcome to NLMech repository. In this project we implement 
nonlocal fracture theory, referred to as Peridynamics, 
using both finite element and finite difference discretization.  

Logo below has been obtained by running Peridynamic simulation on the logo mesh, [see](https://nonlocalmodels.github.io/examples/fd-logo-soft-material.html).
